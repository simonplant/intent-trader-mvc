# Enhanced Intent Trader Requirements Analysis

After reviewing the additional feedback documents from real-world usage, I've synthesized key insights to enhance our GitHub issues. This analysis identifies patterns, gaps, and specific requirements that should be incorporated into our GitHub project.

## Key Themes from Feedback Documents

### 1. Real-Time Orientation and Status Tracking

Multiple documents highlight the critical need for better orientation during active trading sessions:

- **Status Categorization Framework**: The "Already Triggered/Invalidated/Ready Soon/Not Close" framework emerged as a highly effective organizing principle
- **Cognitive Reset Mechanisms**: Users experienced disorientation during fast market moves and needed formal re-centering processes
- **Time-Based Check-ins**: Regular (60-90 minute) mandatory status updates appear necessary

### 2. Information Integration and Prioritization

Several feedback documents highlight challenges with information overload:

- **Source Hierarchy**: Need for formal ranking of information sources during conflicts
- **Temporal Relevance**: Information "decay" mechanism for aging out older signals
- **Standardized Parsing**: Consistent formats for moderator alerts, technical signals

### 3. Market Mode Recognition and Response

The feedback reveals critical gaps in market character identification:

- **Mode Classification**: Need for explicit criteria to identify "Mode 1" (always up) and other market modes
- **Mode-Specific Protocols**: Different execution approaches based on market character
- **Adaptation Triggers**: Clear indicators for when to shift from one mode to another

### 4. Technical Framework Integration

The documents highlight the power of structured technical analysis:

- **Level Precision**: Mancini's framework provided remarkably accurate level projections
- **Chart Legend Integration**: Need for better integration of chart patterns with trade planning
- **Moving Average Context**: MA relationships provide critical context for decision-making

### 5. Execution Gap Improvement

A clear gap exists between planning and execution:

- **Trigger Definition**: Need for explicit, non-ambiguous entry triggers
- **Decision Boundaries**: Clear go/no-go criteria for each trade type
- **Execution Windows**: Defined optimal periods for trade execution

## Requirements Refinement for GitHub Issues

Based on this analysis, I recommend the following enhancements to our GitHub issues:

### New Requirements to Add

### Enhanced Existing Requirements

| Original ID | Enhanced Title | Enhancement Description | Priority Adjustment |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| FE-01 | Headline Defense Protocol + Mode Response | Add mode-specific responses to headline events | Increase to Critical |
| FE-03 | Comprehensive Moderator Influence Management | Expand to include signal weighting, consensus detection | Increase to High |

| SOP-1 | Comprehensive Intraday Reorientation Protocol | Expand with detailed status update process | No change (High) |

## Integration with Mancini Analysis Pre-Staging

One particularly valuable insight from the feedback is the opportunity to integrate Mancini's analysis into a pre-staged workflow the day before trading. This can be developed into a specific requirement:

| ID | Title | Description | Type | Priority | Epic |
|----|-------|-------------|------|----------|------|
| PREP-01 | Mancini Pre-Staging Workflow | Develop process for analyzing Mancini's noon newsletter and creating pre-staged analysis | Feature | High | Premarket Preparation |
| PREP-02 | Chart Legend to Mancini Level Mapping | Create standardized mapping between Mancini levels and chart patterns | Feature | Medium | Premarket Preparation |
| PREP-03 | Decision Point Pre-Visualization | Pre-configure charts with Mancini levels and decision points | Feature | Medium | Premarket Preparation |
| PREP-04 | Morning Validation Workflow | Streamlined process to validate pre-staged analysis with DP insights | Feature | High | Premarket Preparation |
