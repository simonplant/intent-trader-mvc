# 🧠 Intent Trader System Project Plan

## Project Title
`intent-trader-refactor`

## Objective
Incrementally refactor and rebuild the Intent Trader trading system using a schema-first, prompt-validated, and lifecycle-based execution strategy inside ChatGPT Projects.

## Project Phases
1. 📦 Phase 0: Metadata, Routing, and Registry Bootstrapping
2. 🧱 Phase 1: Schema Core Generation
3. 🧠 Phase 2: Blueprint System
4. 💬 Phase 3: Status Tracking System
5. 🪞 Phase 4: Execution Review + Trade Logging
6. 🔐 Phase 5: Resilience + SystemOps Tools

## Prompt Conventions
- Kick off each phase using: `it-implementation-protocol.md`
- Validate each generated component against its schema
- Enforce frontmatter spec from: `metadata-style.md`
- Track output versions in: `changelog.md` + `logs/releases/`

## File Management
- Use ZIPs to exchange or backup full phase bundles
- Each prompt file must include test_case and release metadata
