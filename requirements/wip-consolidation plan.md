## Optimized Implementation Strategy

For efficient implementation and to avoid chat length limits, use this advanced approach:

### File Grouping by Function

**Chat 1: Core Framework Updates**
- `system/sop.md` + `system/status-tracking/framework.md` (combined request)
- `system/main-controller.md` + `system/registry.yaml` (combined request)

**Chat 2: Prompt Creation**
- `prompts/intraday/status-update.md` + `prompts/intraday/chart-analysis.md` (combined request)
- `prompts/intraday/midday-reset.md` + `prompts/system/sizing-rules.md` (combined request)

**Chat 3: Knowledge & Workflow Updates**
- `knowledge/trade-psychology.md` + `knowledge/mancini-insights.md` (combined request)
- `system/risk-management/protocols.md` + `system/workflows/intraday-management.md` (combined request)

### Enhanced Prompt Template for New Chats

```
I need help optimizing my Intent Trader trading system repository. I'll provide key files that need updating based on insights from my recent trading sessions.

For this chat, we'll focus on GROUP_NAME updates. Please help me:

1. Update existing files with new content while maintaining their format structure
2. Create critical new files based on my requirements
3. Consolidate information from specific WIP notes into proper documentation

## Source WIP Notes
The information for these updates comes primarily from:
- `docs/requirements/wip/2025-05-13 - trading-session-review.md` (for status tracking)
- `docs/requirements/wip/sop-intraday-feedback.md` (for SOP updates)
- [Add other specific source documents relevant to this group]

## Files to Update in This Chat

[File 1 contents]
---
[File 2 contents]
---

## Requested Updates

For [File 1]:
- [Specific change 1]
- [Specific change 2]
- [Etc.]

For [File 2]:
- [Specific change 1]
- [Specific change 2]
- [Etc.]

Please provide ONLY the complete updated content for each file without explanations between files.
If creating a new file, begin with "===NEW FILE: [filename]===" before the content.
For existing file updates, simply provide the complete updated file content.
```

### Pre-Processing Efficiency

For maximum efficiency before starting chats:
- Extract and compile only the relevant sections from WIP documents for each chat
- Create "diff templates" highlighting exactly which sections need changes rather than sending entire files
- Prepare skeleton templates for all new files with front matter already populated

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Bootstrap Chat** - Request only the absolutely essential framework files to get started
2. **Parallel Work Chats** - Once core files are complete, run multiple parallel chats for independent components
3. **Integration Chat** - Final chat to ensure cross-referencing and consistency

### Specific Source-to-Destination Mapping

**Core Framework Updates**
- `sop.md`: Source from `sop-intraday-feedback.md` and `trading-session-review.md`
- `status-tracking/framework.md`: Source from `trading-session-review.md` and `backlog feedback intraday.md`
- `main-controller.md`: Source from existing routes and new requirements
- `registry.yaml`: Mirror updates from main-controller.md

**Prompt Creation**
- `status-update.md`: Source from `trading-session-review.md`
- `chart-analysis.md`: Source from `sop-intraday-feedback.md`
- `midday-reset.md`: Source from `sop.md` invalidation triggers
- `sizing-rules.md`: Source from position sizing matrix in WIP notes

**Knowledge & Workflow Updates**
- `trade-psychology.md`: Source from `coaching-feedback.md`
- `mancini-insights.md`: Source from `trading-session-review.md` and `eod-reflection.md`
- `risk-management/protocols.md`: Source from risk protocols in `sop.md`
- `workflows/intraday-management.md`: Source from `trading-session-review.md`

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Update `system/sop.md` with the Intraday Reorientation Protocol from feedback documents
2. Create the Status Tracking Framework documentation
3. Update the Main Controller with new routes
4. Create the most critical missing prompts (`status-update.md`, `chart-analysis.md`)
5. Update knowledge bases with insights from May 13 trading session

This optimized plan leverages the existing architectural strengths identified in the audit report (modularity, metadata enforcement, knowledge system) while enhancing the system with the new capabilities identified from your trading session feedback. The cognitive-deterministic separation pattern from architectural-review.md provides an excellent foundation for the new status tracking and moderator signal frameworks.
