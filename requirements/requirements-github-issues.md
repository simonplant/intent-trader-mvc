# Intent Trader: Requirements Extraction for GitHub

## Requirements Analysis

Based on the repository documents, I've identified several categories of requirements that should be imported to GitHub Issues. I'll organize these by component and priority to create a structured backlog.

## Core System Components

From analyzing the documents, the main components of the Intent Trader system are:

1. **Prompt System**: Structured prompts organized by trading phase
2. **Knowledge Base**: Trading insights, patterns, and models
3. **Logging System**: Trade tracking and behavior analysis
4. **Main Controller**: Routing and system orchestration
5. **Validation Tools**: Testing and verification utilities
