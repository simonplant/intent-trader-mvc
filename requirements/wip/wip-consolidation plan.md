## Revised Implementation Strategy

Based on critical feedback analysis, the implementation approach has been significantly revised to focus on functionality first and address key dependencies:

### Phase 0: Preparation (Day 1)

1. **Create Directory Structure**
   - Create all required directories (`system/status-tracking/`, `system/protocols/`, etc.)
   - Validate directory permissions and access

2. **Metadata Templates**
   - Create templates for each document type with standardized front matter
   - Test front matter validation with existing scripts

3. **Dependency Mapping**
   - Create explicit dependency graph between components
   - Reorder implementation based on dependencies

### Phase 1: Minimum Viable Components (Week 1)

1. **Status Update Prompt (MVP)**
   - Create simplified `prompts/intraday/status-update.md` with core categories
   - Update controller with route
   - Create basic test case with sample trade ideas

2. **Intraday Reorientation Process (MVP)**
   - Add minimal section to `system/sop.md` with core process
   - Implement timer-based reminder system
   - Create checklist template for reorientation

3. **Trial Day Testing**
   - Test MVP components in simulated trading day
   - Document effectiveness and improvement areas

### Phase 2: Framework Documentation (Week 2)

1. **Status Tracking Framework**
   - Create comprehensive `system/status-tracking/framework.md`
   - Document transition rules based on MVP experience
   - Expand status update prompt with technical context

2. **Reorientation Protocol**
   - Develop detailed `system/protocols/intraday-reorientation.md`
   - Refine process based on trial day feedback
   - Add chart context integration section

3. **Integration Checkpoint**
   - Verify all components work together as expected
   - Update controller and registry with final routes

### Phase 3: Advanced Components (Weeks 3-4)

1. **Moderator Signal Framework**
   - Implement based on insights from initial trial days
   - Start with simpler classification before adding weighting
   - Integrate with status tracking system

2. **Technical Framework Integration**
   - Update with focus on real-world pattern recognition
   - Add Mancini level mapping based on verified effectiveness
   - Create chart analysis prompt with practical focus

3. **Final Integration**
   - Comprehensive testing of all components together
   - Document integration patterns and dependencies
   - Create user guide for daily workflow

## Implementation Conversation Structure

For each implementation phase, use this structured conversation format:

```
I need help implementing [Component Name] for my Intent Trader system.

## Background Context
[2-3 sentences describing the problem this component solves]

## Key Source Documents
1. [Document name] - [Specific sections to reference]
2. [Document name] - [Specific sections to reference]

## Files to Create/Update
1. [File path] - [Brief description]
2. [File path] - [Brief description]

## For [File 1]:
[Any existing content or template with front matter]

## Specific Requirements
1. [Requirement 1]
2. [Requirement 2]
3. [Requirement 3]

Please implement these files following the standard Intent Trader documentation format with proper front matter. For new files, ensure they follow the directory structure conventions.
```

## Key Implementation Principles

Based on critical analysis, these principles will guide all implementation work:

1. **Functionality Before Documentation**
   - Create working components before extensive documentation
   - Use real trading sessions to validate effectiveness

2. **Incremental Complexity**
   - Start with simplified MVP versions
   - Add complexity based on validated needs

3. **Integration-Focused Development**
   - Test components together, not just individually
   - Document integration patterns explicitly

4. **Balanced Technical-Cognitive Approach**
   - Equal emphasis on mechanical and psychological aspects
   - Create tools for both process and mental management

5. **Clear Dependencies**
   - Recognize and document component dependencies
   - Order implementation based on these dependencies

## Success Metrics

Implementation success will be measured through:

1. **Reorientation Time** - Target: 50% reduction in time needed to regain orientation
2. **Missed Opportunity Rate** - Target: Eliminate instances of missed opportunities due to disorientation
3. **Execution Quality** - Target: Improve execution quality metrics following periods of high cognitive load
4. **Mode Recognition Time** - Target: Identify day character (Mode 1, etc.) within first 30 minutes of trading

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Create directory structure for all new components
2. Develop metadata templates for each document type
3. Create the Status Update MVP prompt and update controller
4. Add minimal Intraday Reorientation Process to SOP
5. Schedule first trial day to test MVP components
