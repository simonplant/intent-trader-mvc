# ‚úÖ Let's Do This ‚Äî Enhanced Intent Trader Implementation Protocol

This execution protocol provides a structured, validation-oriented approach to implement the complete Enhanced Intent Trader Framework using ChatGPT. Each phase includes clear success criteria, validation checkpoints, and cognitive management guidelines.

---

## üîç PRE-EXECUTION: Context Validation

### üìã Master Upload Checklist
```
upload-checklist.md
```

Before beginning any phase, upload this checklist and run the validation prompt:

```plaintext
Please confirm that all required files for Intent Trader refactoring have been loaded into context. 

List all visible filenames and their types, flagging any missing critical files from this list:
- intent-trader.zip (repository)
- final-implementation-plan.md (master plan)
- wip-consolidation-plan.md (original plan)
- gan-qa-review.md (enhancement feedback)
- schemas.zip (if available)

Also validate that this is a fresh conversation without previous context contamination.

‚úÖ Expected Output: Complete file inventory with validation status
```

### üìä Refactor Status Tracking
Create and maintain a `refactor-progress.md` file:

```
refactor-progress.md
```

Update at the end of each phase with:

```plaintext
Please update the refactor status report with the completion of Phase [X]:

phase: [phase number]
completed_components:
  - [component 1]
  - [component 2]
status: [complete|partial|blocked]

3. Implement prompts with structured format and validation
4. Create integration components with clear interaction models
5. Validate with specific test cases

For each phase, use the structured prompt template:

```plaintext
Today's goal: Implement [component] for Intent Trader.

Please create implementation-ready versions of:

1. [file path] - [component description]
2. [file path] - [component description]
...

Each [component type] should include:
- [requirement 1]
- [requirement 2]
...

Include [specific content requirements].

## üß† Cognitive Load Management During Implementation

Each phase of this refactoring has been assigned a cognitive load rating:

- **Phase 1-2**: MEDIUM (Schema & Blueprint) - Most complex foundational structure
- **Phase 3**: HIGH (Cognitive Framework) - Requires meta-cognitive awareness
- **Phase 4**: MEDIUM (Status Tracking) - Complex state transitions
- **Phase 5-6**: MEDIUM (Moderator & Technical) - Integration complexity
- **Phase 7-8**: LOW (Execution & Learning) - Builds on established components
- **Phase 9**: HIGH (Integration) - System-wide orchestration

Consider scheduling implementation sessions based on cognitive capacity:
- Start with LOW cognitive load phases when mental energy is limited
- Schedule HIGH cognitive load phases during peak mental performance times
- Take breaks between phases to prevent implementation fatigue
- Use the cognitive reset protocol if experiencing decision fatigue
