# TRADE PLAN & STATUS REVIEW (12:55 PM PT)

## MARKET STRUCTURE ASSESSMENT
The market has performed exceptionally today, following a precise bullish path outlined by Mancini. All specified targets have been hit with remarkable accuracy (5874 → 5890 → 5910 → 5927), and ES has established a new support structure at 5890 with 5850 as secondary support.

## ORIGINAL TRADE PLAN VS. CURRENT REALITY

### Big Ideas (Original Plan)
1. **HIMS SHORT** ❌ - Failed completely, moderators exited, stock up +6.03%
2. **SPX/ES LONG** ✅ - Extremely successful, hit all targets
3. **TEM BUY 60-58** ❌ - Never reached entry zone, missed opportunity

### Cashflow Trades (Original Plan)
1. **DIS SHORT** ⚠️ - Mixed results, Kira covered most position, DP entered puts recently
2. **HOOD LONG** ✅ - Profitable, moderators trimmed on strength
3. **TSLA LONG** ✅ - Successful, moderators trimmed profits, Rickman added June 380 calls

### Lotto Watch (Original Plan)
1. **SPX/ES BREAKOUT** ✅ - Played out perfectly, hit all Mancini targets
2. **COIN PULLBACK** ❌ - No pullback materialized in strong market
3. **HMHC SHORT** ❓ - No data available to assess

### SPX Decision Tree (Mancini Structure)
- IF SPX reclaims 5850 → LONG → Targets: 5874, 5890, 5910 ✅ ALL HIT
- Additional bonus targets: 5927 ✅ HIT, 5953 ⏳ PENDING
- New support structure: 5890, 5850

## CURRENT ACTIVE POSITIONS

### Currently Valid
1. **SPX/ES LOTTO RUNNER** - Holding small position per Mancini guidance
2. **RICKMAN'S SPX 5/15 5920 CALLS** - Aligned with continued upside thesis
3. **DP'S DIS MAY 16 111 PUTS** - Selective short in strong market
4. **RICKMAN'S TSLA JUNE 380 CALLS** - Aggressive bullish positioning

### Recently Closed/Trimmed
1. **HIMS SHORT** - Exited by all moderators
2. **XYZ PUTS** - Exited by DP and Kira
3. **HOOD LONG** - Trimmed by moderators
4. **TSLA POSITIONS** - Actively managed with repeated trimming

## EXECUTION QUALITY ASSESSMENT

### Strengths
1. **TARGET ACCURACY**: Market hit all specified levels from Mancini
2. **MODERATOR ADAPTABILITY**: Quick to exit losing positions (HIMS short)
3. **PROFIT MANAGEMENT**: Appropriate trimming on extended moves
4. **DIRECTIONAL FLEXIBILITY**: Rickman pivoted from puts to calls as market demonstrated strength

### Weaknesses
1. **MISSED OPPORTUNITIES**: Several planned entries never materialized (TEM buy zone)
2. **COUNTER-TREND POSITIONING**: Early short attempts worked poorly (HIMS)
3. **TIMING CHALLENGES**: Rickman's SPX puts demonstrated difficulty of timing intraday pullbacks

## CURRENT MARKET STATUS
- **PREDOMINANT PATTERN**: Strong bullish momentum with perfect technical target execution
- **RISK MANAGEMENT PHASE**: Currently in "hold runners only" stage per Mancini
- **SUPPORT STRUCTURE**: New support established at 5890, with 5850 as secondary support
- **NEXT TARGETS**: 5953 identified as final "bonus" target
- **REVERSAL TRIGGER**: "No sell until 50 fails" - likely referring to 50-day MA

## PRIORITY ACTIONS FOR REMAINDER OF SESSION
1. **MAINTAIN DISCIPLINED RUNNER STRATEGY**: Hold small position targeting 5953
2. **MONITOR NEW SUPPORT LEVELS**: Watch 5890 for potential "dip below" as Mancini suggested
3. **RESPECT MODERATOR POSITIONING**: Align with Rickman's calls, DP's selective DIS puts
4. **PREPARE FOR POTENTIAL LATE-DAY EXTENSION**: Often occurs in strong trend days
5. **SET STOPS BASED ON NEW SUPPORT**: Use 5890 as key reference point

## LESSONS FOR FUTURE SESSIONS
1. **PRECISION OF MANCINI TARGETS**: Extremely accurate level projections
2. **IMPORTANCE OF ADAPTABILITY**: Rickman demonstrated by flipping from puts to calls
3. **VALUE OF RUNNER STRATEGY**: Small position retention captures extended moves
4. **CHALLENGE OF COUNTER-TREND TRADES**: HIMS short demonstrated difficulty
5. **BENEFIT OF CLEAR TECHNICAL STRUCTURE**: Support/resistance framework provided clear roadmap

The day has demonstrated the effectiveness of a technically-driven approach with disciplined execution and the willingness to adapt to changing market conditions. The precision of Mancini's target projections has been particularly noteworthy.
