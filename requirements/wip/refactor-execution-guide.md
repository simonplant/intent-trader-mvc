## üß≠ PHASE 0: Session Preparation and Foundation

### üßº New Chat Preparation
- ‚úÖ Upload `intent-trader.zip` (latest build with current structure)
- ‚úÖ Upload `final-implementation-plan.md` (our synthesized plan)
- ‚úÖ Upload `wip-consolidation-plan.md` (original plan)
- ‚úÖ Upload `gan-qa-review.md` (feedback on enhancements)
- ‚úÖ Create and upload a small `schemas.zip` with sample schemas if available

### üèóÔ∏è Initial Session Setup Prompt
```plaintext
I'm implementing the Enhanced Intent Trader Framework following our final implementation plan. Let's start with creating the foundational structure and schemas. Please help me establish the core architecture components for Phase 0.

For context, this is a trading system that combines technical analysis with cognitive tracking to create blueprints that adapt to market conditions and trader state.

First, I need to create:
1. Directory structure
2. Core schema files (metadata.schema.json, blueprint.schema.json)
3. Basic registry discovery script

Please provide implementation-ready content for these components.

```

### Key Implementation Sequence
1. **Core Schemas** ‚Üí **Registry** ‚Üí **Templates**
2. **Blueprint System** ‚Üí **Cognitive Framework** ‚Üí **Status Framework**
3. **Moderator Signals** ‚Üí **Technical Framework** ‚Üí **Execution Framework**
4. **Learning Framework** ‚Üí **System Integration** ‚Üí **Testing**

### Critical Phase Dependencies
- Blueprint system depends on core schemas
- Cognitive framework depends on cognitive-load schema
- Status tracking depends on blueprint and cognitive frameworks
- All prompts depend on their respective frameworks

### Session Management Tips
1. Start a new session for each major phase
2. Upload relevant documents at the start of each session
3. Use the `/zip` command to download completed components at the end of each phase
4. Break implementation into chunks of 3-5 files maximum per prompt
