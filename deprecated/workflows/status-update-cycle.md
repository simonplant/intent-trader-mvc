# ðŸ”ƒ Status Update Cycle

This file outlines when and how status updates should be processed during market hours.

## Update Triggers

- **On Market Open (6:30 AM PT)**:
  - Reset all overnight setups to `WATCHING`
  - Load current blueprint

- **Every 15 Minutes**:
  - Reassess setups marked as `PENDING`
  - Look for entries to move into `ACTIVE`

- **On Entry/Exit Events**:
  - Immediate transition to `ACTIVE` or `COMPLETED`
  - Log transition reason and timestamp

- **Midday Check (11:00 AM PT)**:
  - Reevaluate all `ACTIVE` and `PENDING` statuses
  - Update or invalidate stale setups

- **On News Event**:
  - Interrupt cycle, trigger forced reassessment
