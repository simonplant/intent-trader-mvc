## Proposed Development Workflow

1. **File Generation in Claude**
   - I'll create complete implementation files as artifacts
   - Each file will be ready for direct use with proper frontmatter and content
   - You can download these artifacts from our conversation

2. **Local File Placement**
   - You'll save/copy these files to your local `~/Documents/code/intent-trader/` directory
   - You can place them in the appropriate directories according to our structure

3. **Git Integration**
   - You'll commit the files to your local Git repository
   - Push changes to GitHub when ready
   - Track progress through commits

4. **Phase Implementation**
   - We'll work through each phase systematically:
     1. Core Framework
     2. Trade Planning & Tracking
     3. Performance Analysis
   - Complete each phase before moving to the next for cleaner commits

5. **Testing & Iteration**
   - You can test files locally (if applicable)
   - Share any issues or feedback with me
   - I'll generate updated versions as needed

## Practical Implementation

For each phase, I'll:

1. Generate all files needed for that phase as artifacts
2. Provide clear file paths (e.g., `system/market-context/market-mode.md`)
3. Include any special instructions for implementation

You'll:
1. Save each file to the appropriate location in your local repo
2. Commit changes with phase-specific commit messages
3. Report back any issues or needed adjustments

## Getting Started

Would you like to begin with Phase 1 (Core Framework)? I can start by generating the first set of files:

1. Folder structure creation script (to set up directories)
2. `system/market-context/market-mode.md`
3. Updated `command-map.md` for the new commands
4. Initial schema files
