You're absolutely right - we need to think beyond traditional MVC for cognitive applications. Let me search for modern cognitive/AI application architectures.

Excellent insight! You're absolutely right that we've moved from transactional to cognitive systems. Let me analyze the modern cognitive architecture patterns from the research.

## The Cognitive Application Architecture Paradigm

Cognitive architectures represent a fundamental shift from traditional MVC to systems where LLMs act as the "brain" that decides control flow dynamically, rather than following pre-coded paths. This enables breaking barriers of complexity and static control flows.

### Cognitive MVC Evolution: **Intent → Agent → Action**

Instead of Model-View-Controller, cognitive apps use:

1. **Intent** (replaces Model): Natural language intent detection and context understanding
2. **Agent** (replaces Controller): LLM-powered reasoning that routes and orchestrates
3. **Action** (replaces View): Specialized tools/prompts that execute domain-specific tasks

## Ultra-Reliable Cognitive Architecture for Intent Trader

Based on the research and your requirements, here's the cognitive architecture pattern:

### 1. Intent Detection Layer (The "Router Brain")

Modern agent architectures use routers that allow LLMs to select steps from specified options, providing controlled autonomy with structured outputs.

```markdown
# system/cognitive/intent-detector.md

---

role: Intent Router
capability: Parse natural trading language → structured intent
reliability: Schema-enforced outputs only

---

TRADING INTENT CLASSIFICATION:
Input: "I want to analyze this DP call and create a plan"
Output: {
"intent": "workflow",
"workflow": "morning-analysis",
"steps": ["analyze-dp", "create-plan"],
"context": "premarket"
}
```

### 2. Agent Orchestrator (The "Cognitive Controller")

Modern LLM agents combine planning, memory, and tool usage with an LLM serving as the main controller that orchestrates operations needed to complete tasks.

```markdown
# system/cognitive/orchestrator.md

---

role: Trading Workflow Orchestrator
capability: Execute multi-step trading workflows
reliability: Deterministic routing with validation

---

WORKFLOW EXECUTION:

1. Validate intent against allowed workflows
2. Load required knowledge artifacts
3. Execute steps in dependency order
4. Validate outputs between steps
5. Maintain context across execution
```

### 3. Specialized Knowledge Tools (The "Expert Actions")

The most successful LLM implementations use simple, composable patterns with specialized tools for domain-specific tasks, maintaining transparency and reliability.

```
knowledge/
├── trading-workflows/
│   ├── morning-analysis.yaml      # Workflow definition
│   ├── position-management.yaml   # Position workflows
│   └── review-analysis.yaml       # Review workflows
├── domain-knowledge/
│   ├── dp-analysis-patterns.md    # DP-specific knowledge
│   ├── mancini-setups.md          # Mancini methodology
│   └── risk-management.md         # Risk frameworks
└── execution-tools/
    ├── analyze-dp.md              # Specialized tools
    ├── size-position.md           # Keep existing prompts
    └── create-plan.md             # as execution tools
```

## Ultra-Reliable Architecture Pattern

### Single Source of Truth: Workflow Definitions

```yaml
# knowledge/trading-workflows/morning-analysis.yaml
workflow: morning-analysis
description: Process morning analyst calls into actionable plan
reliability: high
steps:
  - tool: analyze-dp
    requires: [transcript]
    validates: dp-analysis-schema
    produces: market-context, focus-ideas, levels
  - tool: create-plan
    requires: [dp-analysis]
    validates: trade-plan-schema
    produces: unified-plan
context_retention: full
error_handling: graceful_degradation
```

### Knowledge Artifact Structure

```markdown
# knowledge/domain-knowledge/dp-analysis-patterns.md

---

domain: DP Morning Call Analysis
expertise: Extract actionable intelligence from DP commentary
validation: dp-analysis-schema.json
maintenance: Self-contained, version-controlled

---

CONVICTION DETECTION PATTERNS:

- "love this" → high conviction
- "interesting here" → medium conviction
- "might work" → low conviction

SETUP CLASSIFICATIONS:

- "bull flag" → continuation pattern
- "failed breakdown" → reversal setup
- "day after trade" → event-driven
```

## Maintenance-Free Architecture Principles

### 1. Schema-Driven Validation

```json
{
  "dp-analysis-schema": {
    "required": ["marketContext", "focusIdeas", "levels"],
    "validation": "strict",
    "fallback": "graceful_degradation"
  }
}
```

### 2. Workflow State Management

```markdown
# system/cognitive/state-manager.md

CONTEXT PRESERVATION:

- Maintain conversation context across workflow steps
- Preserve trading session state
- Enable resumption from failure points
- Track workflow execution history
```

### 3. Self-Healing Reliability

LLM agents can engage in self-reflection, analyzing their own output to identify issues and make necessary improvements, creating a cycle of continuous enhancement.

```markdown
# system/cognitive/reliability-monitor.md

SELF-MONITORING:

- Validate outputs against schemas
- Detect degraded performance patterns
- Auto-retry with refined prompts
- Escalate to human when confidence low
```

## Benefits of This Cognitive Architecture

1. **Ultra-Low Maintenance**: Knowledge artifacts are self-contained and versioned
2. **Best Practices**: Schema validation, workflow definitions, expert knowledge separation
3. **Reliable Routing**: Intent detection → workflow selection → tool execution
4. **Cognitive Flexibility**: Natural language interaction with structured execution
5. **Domain Expertise**: Specialized knowledge tools maintain trading intelligence

## Implementation Strategy

Start with this minimal cognitive stack:

```
system/
├── cognitive/
│   ├── intent-detector.md     # Natural language → workflow routing
│   ├── orchestrator.md        # Workflow execution engine
│   └── state-manager.md       # Context & session management
├── schemas/
│   ├── trading-intent.json    # Canonical schema (as planned)
│   └── workflow-definition.json
└── knowledge/
    ├── workflows/             # YAML workflow definitions
    ├── domain-knowledge/      # Trading expertise (MD files)
    └── execution-tools/       # Your existing prompts as tools
```

This cognitive architecture gives you the reliability of traditional frameworks with the intelligence and flexibility of modern LLM systems. The key insight is treating your existing prompts as specialized "tools" that the cognitive orchestrator can intelligently combine based on natural language intent.
