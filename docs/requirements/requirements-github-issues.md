# Intent Trader: Requirements Extraction for GitHub

## Requirements Analysis

Based on the repository documents, I've identified several categories of requirements that should be imported to GitHub Issues. I'll organize these by component and priority to create a structured backlog.

## Core System Components

From analyzing the documents, the main components of the Intent Trader system are:

1. **Prompt System**: Structured prompts organized by trading phase
2. **Knowledge Base**: Trading insights, patterns, and models
3. **Logging System**: Trade tracking and behavior analysis
4. **Main Controller**: Routing and system orchestration
5. **Validation Tools**: Testing and verification utilities

```

## Importing Process

To import these requirements into GitHub:

1. **Create CSV file** with the format above, including all requirements
2. **Use GitHub CSV Tools** (npm package `github-csv-tools`) for bulk import
3. **Configure milestones** in GitHub before import to match the Epics
4. **Create labels** for all the components and types identified above
5. **Review imported issues** and adjust as needed

## Next Steps

1. Review this requirements extraction to ensure it captures all system needs
2. Finalize the CSV export format with additional fields if needed
3. Create necessary labels and milestones in GitHub
4. Import the data using one of the available tools
5. Organize the Project Board views for different stakeholders
