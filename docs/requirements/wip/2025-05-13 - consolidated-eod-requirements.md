I'll analyze and synthesize the feedback documents to enhance our GitHub issues requirements. These documents provide valuable real-world usage insights that should be incorporated into the GitHub issues we're creating.

Let me analyze these documents and integrate their insights into our requirements framework:

I've carefully analyzed your feedback documents from real-world usage of the Intent Trader system and created comprehensive resources to enhance your GitHub project:

## 1. Enhanced Requirements Analysis

I've synthesized key insights from your trading session feedback into a structured analysis that identifies:

- **Orientation challenges** during active trading that resulted in missed opportunities
- **Status tracking frameworks** that proved effective in real usage
- **Market mode recognition** needs to quickly identify different market behaviors
- **Information integration challenges** when dealing with multiple sources
- **Execution gaps** between planning and taking action

## 2. New Requirements CSV

I've created an enhanced CSV file with 22 new detailed requirements directly derived from your feedback documents. Each requirement includes:

- Clear acceptance criteria
- Appropriate labels and priorities
- Milestone assignments
- Detailed descriptions grounded in real-world observations

Key categories of new requirements include:
- Status Update Framework
- Market Mode Classification
- Moderator Signal Tracking
- Mancini Pre-Staging Workflow
- Execution Trigger Definition
- Cognitive Reset Mechanisms

## 3. Enhanced GitHub Setup Guide

I've provided a detailed guide for implementing these feedback-derived requirements, including:

- Additional label and milestone setup
- Specialized project views based on implementation sequence
- Phased roadmap reflecting real-world priorities
- Contextual documentation approach
- Tracking system for feedback implementation

## Key Insights from Feedback

The feedback documents revealed several critical insights:

1. **The "Already Triggered/Invalidated/Ready Soon/Not Close" categorization system** provided exceptional clarity during active trading and should be formalized

2. **Mancini's noon newsletter** (available the day before trading) creates an opportunity for pre-staging analysis that wasn't fully captured in the original requirements

3. **Market mode recognition** (especially identifying "Mode 1" always-up days) represents a significant P&L opportunity that requires specific functionality

4. **Regular cognitive reorientation** at 60-90 minute intervals helps prevent feeling lost during active trading sessions

5. **Technical framework validation** showed remarkable precision of Mancini's targets (hit "to the tick") and should be fully leveraged

## Next Steps

1. Download the enhanced requirements CSV
2. Follow the enhanced GitHub setup guide
3. Implement the high-priority items first, focusing on orientation frameworks
4. Use the phased roadmap to guide implementation sequence

These enhancements directly address the real-world challenges observed in your trading sessions while building on the successful elements already in place. The resulting GitHub project will be much better aligned with your actual usage patterns and will lead to more effective trading execution.
