# Intent Trader Plan v0.5.4 — DP Mindset Modeling

## Purpose

This release will focus on codifying and embedding the mindset, conviction model, and execution logic of DP (David Prince) as a structured decision-support layer.

This enables:

* Trade idea extraction and prioritization based on DP-style phrasing and tone
* Replication of the call logic in case of absence, dilution, or coaching phase retirement
* Capturing not just levels, but *how DP thinks*, *how he sizes*, and *when he stays out*

## Milestone Objective

**"I can make DP-style calls and trade prioritization decisions even without hearing the live call."**

---

## Feature Scope

This release spans all stages of the PFEMRC cycle — from planning and filtering to execution and review — as modeled through DP’s trading philosophy.

### 1. DP Voice Codex (PFEMRC-wide)

* [ ] Consolidate notes from 10+ ruled notebooks into structured assertions
* [ ] Break down: conviction signals, risk language, call tone, setup filtering, execution posture, stop/trim/risk tolerance, and review narratives
* [ ] Classify trade setups: dat long, reversal short, character change, inflection bounces, etc.

### 2. PFEMRC Trade Classifier by Language

* [ ] Input: morning transcript block
* [ ] Output: classified trade type, conviction, suggested sizing, sentiment
* [ ] Incorporate phrase weight, market alignment, idea tiers

### 3. Conviction + Risk Engine (DP Model v1)

* [ ] Learn from historical calls what phrases correlate to real execution
* [ ] Build an interpretable scoring engine for idea quality
* [ ] Surface which trades to ignore, which to tier into, which to hammer

### 4. DP Substitution Prompt

* [ ] Prompt that answers: "What would DP say about this setup, right now, at this stage of the PFEMRC cycle?"
* [ ] Inputs: ticker, setup, market mode, technicals
* [ ] Outputs: structured trade idea or pass, with reasoning
