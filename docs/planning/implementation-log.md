## Implementation Notes

### Core Decisions
- Using a template-based approach for outputs
- Prioritizing accuracy of high-conviction trade extraction
- Implementing the 75/15/10 rule for position management (Mancini strategy)
- Supporting "trading around a core" method for DP positions
- Focusing on minimal but functional implementations for MVP
- Developed standardized conviction classification methodology to ensure consistent trade prioritization
- Created hierarchical level framework with significance scoring
- Implemented scenario-based planning to handle different market conditions
- Built risk allocation framework tied to conviction levels
- Designed modular components with clear interfaces for future extensibility
- Simplified Position Manager implementation to improve maintainability
- Implemented separate position tracking for personal trades and IC moderator calls
- Position Sizing implementation directly ties to Trading Charter risk parameters

### Issues Encountered
- Initial Position Manager implementation was overly complex; streamlined design substantially to improve maintainability
- Added ownership tracking to support different position sources (personal vs. IC moderator)

### Recent Decisions
- Deferred Runner Management (`/manage-runner`) to v0.5.2 as it's Mancini-specific functionality and not critical for DP-focused MVP
- Modified Position Sizing implementation to focus on DP's "trading around a core" methodology instead of Mancini's 75/15/10 rule
- Added practical position size warnings for expensive instruments like SPX options

### Current Blockers
- None at present

## Next Up
- Begin Integration Testing
- Implement Trade Logger (stretch goal)
- Develop Session Debrief (stretch goal)

## MVP Status Summary
- **Plan Phase**: Complete (3/3 components done)
- **Focus Phase**: Complete (2/2 components done)
- **Execute Phase**: Complete (2/2 components done)
- **Manage Phase**: 50% complete (Position Management done, Runner Management deferred to v0.5.2)
- **Review Phase**: Not Started
- **Integration Testing**: Not Started
- **Overall MVP Progress**: 85% complete
