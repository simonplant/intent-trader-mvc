# Unified Trade Plan Generator Implementation

## Context
I'm building an AI-assisted trading system called Intent Trader. The system needs to generate a comprehensive trade plan that integrates insights from multiple analyst sources (primarily DP and Mancini) into a single, actionable strategy document. This Unified Trade Plan represents the trader's synthesized view and prioritized approach to the trading session.

## Implementation Requirements

Create a complete implementation for the `/create-plan` command that can:
1. Generate a unified trade plan from processed analyst inputs (DP and Mancini)
2. Integrate level frameworks with consensus strength scoring
3. Prioritize trade ideas based on conviction and confirmation
4. Incorporate market mode/character analysis for strategic context
5. Develop conditional scenario branches with triggers and responses
6. Create a risk allocation framework aligned with setup types
7. Generate an execution sequence with management protocols
8. Produce a comprehensive, well-formatted plan document

The implementation should follow this structure:
- Front matter with metadata
- Clear purpose statement
- Input/output schemas
- Integration methodology for DP and Mancini inputs
- Level integration algorithm
- Setup prioritization system
- Scenario generation logic
- Risk allocation framework
- Position management protocol
- Template formats
- Example usage

## Input Structure

The command should take input in this format:
```json
{
  "marketContext": {
    "futures": {"status": "string", "catalysts": ["string"]},
    "indices": {"dow": {"direction": "string", "change": "string"}, "nasdaq": {"direction": "string", "change": "string"}},
    "keyMovers": [{"ticker": "string", "direction": "string", "magnitude": "string", "reason": "string"}],
    "sentiment": "string"
  },
  "focusIdeas": [
    {
      "ticker": "string",
      "direction": "long/short",
      "conviction": {"level": "high/medium/low", "phrases": ["string"]},
      "entryParameters": {"zone": {"min": "number", "max": "number"}, "condition": "string"},
      "exitParameters": {"stopLoss": "number", "target": "number"},
      "rationale": "string"
    }
  ],
  "levels": {
    "indices": {
      "es": {"support": [{"value": "number"}], "resistance": [{"value": "number"}]},
      "spx": {"support": [{"value": "number"}], "resistance": [{"value": "number"}]}
    },
    "stocks": [
      {
        "ticker": "string",
        "levels": {"support": [{"value": "number"}], "resistance": [{"value": "number"}]},
        "movingAverages": {"ma8": "number", "ma21": "number"}
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Output Format

The command should produce a formatted markdown plan like this:
```markdown

## Implementation Deliverable

Please create the complete implementation as an artifact suitable for the file path:
`prompts/premarket/create-plan.md`

The implementation should include:
1. Proper frontmatter with metadata
2. Clear purpose statement and description
3. Input parameter definitions
4. Complete processing logic that addresses:
   - Level integration with consensus strength calculation
   - Conviction classification and prioritization
   - Mode and character integration
   - Scenario generation with conditional logic
   - Risk allocation framework aligned with conviction
   - Execution sequence generation
5. Output format specification with detailed template
6. Example usage demonstrations
7. Test vector with sample processing

The implementation should be optimized for:
1. Effectively integrating the unique strengths of both DP and Mancini methodologies
2. Creating a clear, hierarchical level structure with consensus scoring
3. Prioritizing opportunities based on both conviction and technical validation
4. Developing a cohesive strategy with conditional scenarios
5. Establishing consistent position management protocols (75/15/10 rule)
6. Producing a highly actionable trading plan that serves as the central framework for the trading day
