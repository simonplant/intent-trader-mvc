# Implementation Log

## Purpose
This log tracks the implementation progress of Intent Trader components, capturing completed work, decisions made, and issues encountered.

## Log Format
Each entry includes:
- **Date**: When the implementation was completed
- **Component**: Name of the implemented component
- **Status**: Complete/Partial/Issues
- **File Path**: Where the implementation is stored
- **Notes**: Implementation details, decisions, or issues
- **Dependencies**: Components that depend on this one
- **Testing Status**: Whether the component has been tested

## Implementation Log Entries

| Date | Component | Status | File Path | Notes | Dependencies | Testing Status |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|--------------|----------------|
| May 15, 2025 | Morning Call Processor | Complete | `prompts/premarket/analyze-dp.md` | Implemented extraction of market context, focus trades, and key levels with conviction classification. Optimized for identifying high-conviction trade ideas from DP morning calls. | Unified Trade Plan Generator, Trade Idea Extractor, Level Extractor | Basic Testing Complete |
| May 15, 2025 | Conviction Classification System | Complete | `system/focus/conviction-classifier.md` | Created standardized framework for classifying trade ideas by conviction level (high/medium/low) based on analyst language patterns. | Morning Call Processor | Basic Testing Complete |

## Implementation Notes

### Core Decisions
- Using a template-based approach for outputs
- Prioritizing accuracy of high-conviction trade extraction
- Implementing the 75/15/10 rule for position management
- Focusing on minimal but functional implementations for MVP
- Developed standardized conviction classification methodology to ensure consistent trade prioritization

### Issues Encountered
- None significant during initial component implementation

### Current Blockers
- None at present

## Next Up
- Implement Unified Trade Plan Generator [`/create-plan`]
- Develop Trade Idea Extractor [`/extract-focus`]
- Create Level Extractor [`/extract-levels`]

## MVP Status Summary
- **Plan Phase**: Partially Complete (2/3 components done)
- **Focus Phase**: Not Started
- **Execute Phase**: Not Started
- **Manage Phase**: Not Started
- **Review Phase**: Not Started
- **Integration Testing**: Not Started
