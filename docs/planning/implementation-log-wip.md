# Implementation Log

## Purpose
This log tracks the implementation progress of Intent Trader components, capturing completed work, decisions made, and issues encountered.

## Log Format
Each entry includes:
- **Date**: When the implementation was completed
- **Component**: Name of the implemented component
- **Status**: Complete/Partial/Issues
- **File Path**: Where the implementation is stored
- **Notes**: Implementation details, decisions, or issues
- **Dependencies**: Components that depend on this one
- **Testing Status**: Whether the component has been tested

## Implementation Log Entries

## Implementation Notes

### Core Decisions
- Using a template-based approach for outputs
- Prioritizing accuracy of high-conviction trade extraction
- Implementing the 75/15/10 rule for position management
- Focusing on minimal but functional implementations for MVP
- Developed standardized conviction classification methodology to ensure consistent trade prioritization
- Created hierarchical level framework with significance scoring
- Implemented scenario-based planning to handle different market conditions
- Built risk allocation framework tied to conviction levels

### Issues Encountered
- None significant during initial component implementation

### Current Blockers
- None at present

## Next Up
- Implement Position Manager [`/add-position`, `/list-positions`, `/update-position`, `/close-position`]
- Develop Position Sizing [`/size-position`]
- Create Runner Management [`/manage-runner`]
