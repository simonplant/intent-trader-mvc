# Implementation Log

## Purpose
This log tracks the implementation progress of Intent Trader components, capturing completed work, decisions made, and issues encountered.

## Log Format
Each entry includes:
- **Date**: When the implementation was completed
- **Component**: Name of the implemented component
- **Status**: Complete/Partial/Issues
- **File Path**: Where the implementation is stored
- **Notes**: Implementation details, decisions, or issues
- **Dependencies**: Components that depend on this one
- **Testing Status**: Whether the component has been tested

## Implementation Notes

### Core Decisions
- Using a template-based approach for outputs
- Prioritizing accuracy of high-conviction trade extraction
- Implementing the 75/15/10 rule for position management (Mancini strategy)
- Supporting "trading around a core" method for DP positions
- Focusing on minimal but functional implementations for MVP
- Developed standardized conviction classification methodology to ensure consistent trade prioritization
- Created hierarchical level framework with significance scoring
- Implemented scenario-based planning to handle different market conditions
- Built risk allocation framework tied to conviction levels
- Designed modular components with clear interfaces for future extensibility
- Simplified Position Manager implementation to improve maintainability
- Implemented separate position tracking for personal trades and IC moderator calls

### Issues Encountered
- Initial Position Manager implementation was overly complex; streamlined design substantially to improve maintainability
- Added ownership tracking to support different position sources (personal vs. IC moderator)

### Current Blockers
- None at present

## Next Up
- Implement Position Sizing [`/size-position`]
- Create Runner Management [`/manage-runner`]
- Develop Trade Logger (stretch goal)

## MVP Status Summary
- **Plan Phase**: Complete (3/3 components done)
- **Focus Phase**: Complete (2/2 components done)
- **Execute Phase**: Partial (Position Manager complete, Position Sizing pending)
- **Manage Phase**: Partial (Position update/close complete, Runner Management pending)
- **Review Phase**: Not Started
- **Integration Testing**: Not Started
