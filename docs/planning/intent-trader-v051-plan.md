# Intent Trader v0.5.1 MVP Plan (Final Update)

This document defines the scope, architecture, and development priorities for delivering a working MVP (minimum viable product) of the Intent Trader system by tomorrow/Monday. It focuses on providing immediate trading value while establishing the foundation for future iterations.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ MVP Definition

The MVP must support a full trading session for a single user, aligned to a hybrid structure:

### Temporal Sessions:
- **Pre-Market Session**: Plan + Focus _(MVP CORE)_
- **Open Market Session**: Execute + Manage _(MVP CORE)_
- **Post-Market Session**: Review _(MVP CORE)_

### Cognitive Workflow:
- **Plan â†’ Focus â†’ Execute â†’ Manage â†’ Review**

This framework supports the end-to-end trading workflow while prioritizing the components most critical for making money tomorrow.
