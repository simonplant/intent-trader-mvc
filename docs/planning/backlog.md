## Technical Debt & Refactoring

### Runtime Protocol Enforcement (from INSTALL.md Diagnostics)

- [ ] Add schema validation for `state/session-manifest.json`
- [ ] Require presence checks for `runtime-agent.md` and `command-map.md`
- [ ] Abort runtime if `command-map.md` is malformed or empty
- [ ] Define log format for `logs/runtime-init.log` (timestamp, event, status, file, error)
- [ ] Optional: Add integrity check (e.g. SHA256) for critical runtime files
- [ ] Replace “parse and load if present” with required file assertion
- [ ] Rename “Extensible Load Support” section to “Optional Component Discovery”

- [ ] Standardize command parameter formatting
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Improve error handling for all commands
- [ ] Better logging system for debug/audit
- [ ] Create migration scripts for schema updates
