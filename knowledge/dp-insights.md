# David Prince Mental Model

## Premarket Framework
- Look for overnight gaps, earnings reactions, and where juice is concentrated.
- Focus on catalyst-driven names (news, earnings, macro flows).
- Think about “where will the money come from today?”
- Only plan to trade what you *would* size into.

## Intraday Execution
- Big idea? Size and manage around it.
- “Selling into” = start trimming.
- “Needs setup” = let it breathe.
- “Gave you a gift” = pullback entry, especially after early morning strength.

## Postmarket Debrief
- Did you execute the best setup?
- Did you size up the A+ idea?
- Were you emotional? Did you tilt?

## Trade Classifier
| Type        | Action                                  |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| Big Idea    | Size in tiers, manage core, ride runner |
| Swing Setup | Full size with levels                   |
| Cashflow    | Quick hit, don't overstay               |
| Fade        | Trade against the herd at a level       |
