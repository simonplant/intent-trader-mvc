# Mancini Trade Framework

## Core Philosophy
- Price is always trying to trap.
- Structure and failed breakdowns = low-risk entries.
- Levels = decision points.

## Premarket Planning
- Look for price relative to: traps, key MAs, prior day H/L.
- Plan for 3 types of moves: break, trap, backtest.

## Trade Execution
| Setup Type        | Entry Zone          | Target                 |
|-------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Failed Breakdown  | Reclaim + hold trap | Return to range highs  |
| Backtest          | Test key level      | Continuation trend     |
| Structure Break   | Break + hold        | Next measured move     |
