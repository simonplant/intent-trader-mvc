/preprocess-mancini "4 Green Days In A Row. Can SPX Close Week With 5, Or Are Bulls Out Of Steam? May 16 Plan

MAY 16, 2025 âˆ™ PAID
Everyday since the market bottomed on April 6th, I've began this newsletter in a similar way. While I am a day trader, its essential to know the broad regime the market is in (buy dips? or sell bounces?) This is critical to know even as a day trader, because the #1 source losses for new ES traders is counter-trending it when it is in "buy dips mode".

There is not a market on earth or in history more unforgiving to shorts and everyday since April 6th, I've made it clear that ES is firmly in buy dips mode.

For the last week, the more moderated dip buying we saw for the month after April 6th went parabolic. I've also discussed at length that institutions buy dips in a particular way. They put in my core setup, the Failed Breakdown, whereby they flush a major low, trap shorts, recover the low, then squeeze.

FAILED BREAKDOWN WATCH:
- ES 5900: Watch for drop below then reclaim for potential long to 5945+
- SPX 5920: Corresponding SPX level for FB setup

SCENARIOS:
Bull Case: Break above 5970 targets 6000+, probability 60%
Bear Case: Break below 5880 that holds targets 5850, then potentially 5800, probability 40%

For runner management, if you have any ES longs from yesterday:
- Raise stops to 5880
- Consider trailing 15-20 points below price if we break 5970

Today's trading strategy: Be patient for range resolution. Wait for Failed Breakdown setups or clean breaks with acceptance. Size appropriately for the current higher volatility environment."
