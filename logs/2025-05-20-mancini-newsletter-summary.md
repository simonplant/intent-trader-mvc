## Next Session Trading Plan

### Critical Levels to Monitor
* **Primary Resistance**: 5977, 5987, 6000 (major), 6026-30 (major)
* **Primary Support**: 5970 (major), 5945, 5936 (major), 5925 (major), 5890 (major)
* **Current Position**: Holding 10% long runner from Monday morning 5925 Failed Breakdown

### Bull Case Scenario
* Bulls maintain control above 5925
* Potential flagging pattern between 5970/5963 and Monday's highs
* Next targets: 6000, 6026-30, 6047, then 6070

### Bear Case Scenario
* Begins with loss of 5925 support
* Would require a bounce at 5925 followed by failure
* Short below the bounce low (possibly 5925 or 5917)
* Targets: 5890, 5883, then potentially 5850, 5836, 5797-5788

### Special Considerations
* ES has not had a Mode 1 red day (open-to-close trend down) in over a month
* Market is in a lower volatility cycle compared to early April's high volatility
* Author primarily trades Failed Breakdowns and avoids shorts, staying sidelined during direct downtrends
* Contract roll notice: ES rolled from March (ESH2025) to June (ESM2025) in mid-March

## TOMORROW'S FOCUS

1. **Primary Levels**: Monitor 5970, 5925, and 5890 as the three most critical decision points
   * 5970: First major support, already defended for hours on Monday
   * 5925: Acts as mid-pivot in potential 5970-5850 range; multiple successful tests
   * 5890: Next major support if 5925 fails

2. **Key Setup Triggers**:
   * Failed Breakdown of 5970 with tag of 5963 recent low
   * Failed Breakdown of 5925 with recovery above 5931
   * Failed Breakdown of today's low (5893), especially if it tags 5890 or 5883

3. **Risk Management**:
   * Take profits systematically at key levels (75% at first level, more at second level)
   * Leave runners to capture larger moves (10% position for trend continuation)
   * Stay in "profit protection mode" after winning trades

4. **Timing Considerations**:
   * Best setups typically occur before 11AM or after 3PM
   * Avoid trading between 11AM-2PM (often choppy)
