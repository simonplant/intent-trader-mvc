## ⭐ Next Session Trading Plan

### Critical Levels to Monitor:
* **Primary Support:** 5925 (major) - The most critical level to watch; breakout of this bull flag triggered current rally
* **Secondary Supports:** 5963, 5945, 5900, 5880-84
* **Primary Resistance:** 5970-75 (current level), 6000 (psychological barrier)

### Bull Case Scenario:
* Continued uptrend with new flagging pattern forming between 5970-75 and 5945
* Targets: 6000, followed by 6030, 6040, 6070
* Ultra-bull case: ES doesn't even back-test 5925 again and continues higher immediately

### Bear Case Scenario:
* Begins only on failure below 5925 support
* If 5925 fails, initial targets 5890, 5880-84
* For stronger breakdown, would need to lose Thursday's 5868 low
* Distant targets at 5815-20 and 5771 if selling accelerates

### Special Conditions:
* Monday trading following strong Friday often sees "hangover effect"
* Recently completed OPEX (Options Expiration) on Friday which typically produces choppy conditions
* No significant economic reports mentioned for Monday

### Current Positions:
* Author holding 10% runner from 5890 Failed Breakdown
* Additional 10% runner from 5925 Back-Test long

## Notable Trading Examples & Education

* **Double/Triple Dip Failed Breakdowns:** When institutions accumulate at the same level multiple times, forming a pattern where price repeatedly flushes below a support level, recovers it, and then moves higher. The Wednesday/Thursday action at 5900-5890 demonstrated this pattern perfectly.
* **Rubber Band Effect:** The further price flushes below a key level before recovering (like Thursday's move to 5868), the more powerful the subsequent rally tends to be.
* **Level-to-Level Approach:** Author emphasizes "The Golden Rule" - 90% of intraday moves do not follow through to produce smooth trend days. Therefore, systematic profit-taking at predetermined levels is essential.
* **Trade Management Over Entry:** Consistently taking profits at predetermined levels with runners for trend exposure is more important than entry technique.

## ⭐ Tomorrow's Focus

### Primary Levels:
* **5925** - Most critical support level; breakdown below opens door for bears
* **5970-75** - Current resistance; holding above supports continued momentum
* **6000** - Next major psychological barrier if uptrend continues

### Setup Conditions:
* Watch for potential Failed Breakdown of 5925 (with flush to 5918 or 5910) as primary long setup
* If 5925 fails, wait for clear evidence of support at 5880-84 or Failed Breakdown of 5868
* Avoid chasing shorts in strong uptrend - wait for clear breakdowns if bearish

### Risk Management:
* Implement level-to-level profit taking (75% at first level, more at second level)
* Leave runners to capture potential trend continuation
* After first winning trade, protect profits by only risking previous gains on any additional trades

### Timing Considerations:
* Best trading opportunities typically occur before 11am or after 3pm
* Avoid 11am-2pm window which often produces chop
* Limit to 1-2 trades per day, preferably in morning session
