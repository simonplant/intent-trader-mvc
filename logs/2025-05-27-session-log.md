🧾 Intent Trader Daily Log

Date: May 27, 2025 (Tuesday)
Session Type: Full Session (Post-Holiday)
Status: No Trade Day – Perfect Discipline

⸻

✅ Market Overview
	•	Catalyst: Tariff relief paused to July → futures gapped up
	•	SPX Context: Opened above Mancini’s 5262 support → confirmed trend
	•	Macro Bias: Bullish, but extended. Pre-NVDA earnings (Weds), PCE (Fri)

⸻

📋 Unified Trade Plan

Aspect	Guidance
Bias	Bullish continuation if 5262/5232 SPX holds
Primary Action	Trim extended names: $TQQQ, $SOXL, $UNH, $CRWD
Entry Triggers	Longs only on valid pullbacks or confirmed breakout > 5325 SPX
Caution Flags	Gap-up open, holiday skew, headline-driven volatility
Big Ideas	None – “Be thankful you’re long” was DP’s tone


⸻

🧠 Personal Execution

Area	Notes
Trades Taken	None
Rationale	No new swing setups; avoided chasing open gap
Alignment	Fully aligned to unified plan and moderator caution
Improvement	None required – day was not set up for new exposure
