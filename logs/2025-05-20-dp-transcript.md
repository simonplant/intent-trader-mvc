The futures are quiet after yesterday's remarkable rally. We are really flat on the Dow futures, NASDAQ futures down 50. Home Depot reports a mixed quarter. They beat on the top line, slight miss on the bottom line, but I think the stock is higher because they back the guidance for the year. Home Depot up 7 or 8 last I saw. Again, they back guidance for the year, but it was a mixed quarter. Palo Alto Networks beats on both the bottom and top line. Not really an earning story. Perhaps it's about the call. Stock is up a little under a dollar. Last I saw an NBIS reports what looks like a mixed quarter. But I think what's important is they point to positive EBITDA going forward for 2025. That's NBIS, which was down 50 cents and now up 50-60 cents.

JPM had their, oh, before I forget, Palo Alto, that's the big report this evening. I'm actually positive into the print. Got to see if calls will pay. I'll be looking at the size of the expected move, that's PANW, their report this evening. I think it'll be a beat-and-raise quarter. JPM had their annual investor day yesterday, and it was pretty positive overall. A few little things, they talked about lower guidance as far as banking goes, but overall, after going down four or five, the stock bounced back, everyone's updating their numbers. So JPM price target has raised at $300 from $281 at BAFA, they have a buy, price target's raised to $236 from like $235 at Morgan Stanley. Bottom line, they have an equal weight. JPM price target raised to $296 from $260 over at Piper and a few other analysts come out on it.

Spotify price target raised to $775 from $700, they have a buy. And TEM, the price target is raised on Tempest AI to $68 from $48 at BAFA, but they have a neutral rating. MDB is the downgrade of the day. It's downgraded to hold from buy over at a loop. They have a $190 price target all the way down from $350 that's in front of earnings. Stock is down a few dollars pre-market.

Boeing, price target raised to $249 from $218 at Bernstein. They have an outperformed rating. And UnitedHealth, price target lowered to $390 from $501 at Wolff. They do think the stock works and they have an outperformed rating. Uber which closed at new all-time highs yesterday, price targets raised to $105 from $92 at JP Morgan. They are very positive. The stock Asana downgraded to underweight from equal weight at Morgan Stanley ASAN. I don't even know why I follow it anymore.

AMD is reiterated neutral over at Citi. And NVIDIA is reiterated buy over at Citi with the $150 price target. Again, NVIDIA earnings next week. Dell, Citi reiterates outperform at $120 target. For today, not a ton to do, but Home Depot, Palo Alto, NBIS are definitely day-after plays.

Palo Alto, I'll be looking at calls to see how they're priced and if I want to take a shot with some lotto calls for this evening's print. HOOD closed very strong. Someone corrected me, not important to me. But technically they're not all-time highs. When they first came public it was higher. But HOOD did close at its second closest, second highest close in the last 3-4 years, but yes back in 2021 or 22 sometime like that. It was higher near $80. It's just a very, very strong consolidation right in front of what are all-time highs. So kind of looking very strong there. If I pull back to $60, that's where the eight-day is. I'd probably add to stock or put on some calls.

Kira mentioned CrowdStrike looking pretty solid. Basically just idling right in front of all-time highs. I imagine Palo Alto will probably decide whether it breaks out yet again or not. Today is quantum day. I believe there's a virtual conference over at JPM, and we're already seeing a bunch of announcements.

QBTS, I know a bunch of you are in it from $7, and I always said this next breakout if it took out the all-time high of $11, you got $14s, we're here we're almost at $15, so I would trim and trail there, but there may be some trades in today as this conference goes on and announcements happen, so I would pay attention to the IONQs, the QBTSs, the QUBTs, the RGTIs to get the idea again. QBTS whether IONQ is more of a real company or not, the leading stock in that space is undoubtedly QBTS, which is breaking out to more new highs this morning.

Other stocks I'll take a look at, Kira I remember yesterday, and I believe it was Craig as well, said you know that third day up in UNH might be a cute short, so that's something to potentially look at as it comes into its eight-day. And, by the way, I don't think they're looking for super huge run. There was insider buying, stock's had a lot, but a reversal, like green-to-red sort of thing.

AMD, 10-day, $110 I'd be interested. Archer, which has had a wonderful breakout, 10-day, $10.60s I'd be interested, and Tesla has a big event as far as we go today because Elon will be sitting down with David Faber at 2 p.m. to talk about autonomous driving and robots. So you imagine the stock will be in play before and certainly after. Again, that's Elon and David Faber at 2 p.m. market time or eastern standard time, which is the same thing on CNBC.

And then finally, Amazon missed it yesterday, still a bit painful, but bottom line, $200 is the 200-day, it'd be buyable. That's what I have for you this morning. Welcome back.
