|-----------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------|
| Reclaim 5925 ES | 5905      | Bull case resumes                          |
| Flush 5918/5910 | 5898–5890 | Failed breakdown buys (must see acceptance) |
| Deeper flush    | 5868/5860 | Last-stand support, only buy on recovery   |

### Bearish Scenarios

| Trigger      | SPX Level | Notes                                         |
|--------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Lose 5900 ES | 5880      | Breakdown trade activates                     |
| Fail to reclaim 5925 | <5905 | Short bias continues if 5925 rejection confirmed |

### Key Targets

| Direction | SPX Levels | Source                        |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------|
| Upside    | 5914, 5925, 5945, 5967, 5980, 6011 | Based on Mancini upside targets and DP conviction |
| Downside  | 5880, 5860, 5840, 5815             | Below 5900 unlocks these levels |

## Intraday Execution Plan

- Trade only at planned levels with confirmation (acceptance)
- Lock in 75% profits at the first level up
- Leave 10% runner using trailing stop
- If first trade is green, stop trading (profit protection mode)
- If first trade is red, one more attempt allowed, using profits only

### Intraday Scenario Matrix

| Setup Type | Trigger Level | Action                 | Target(s)        | Stop / Invalidate     |
|------------|---------------|------------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Long       | 5905          | Reclaim and accept     | 5914, 5925, 5945 | Fail under 5890        |
| Long       | 5890          | Failed breakdown reclaim | 5910, 5925       | Fail under 5860        |
| Short      | 5880          | Break and hold below   | 5860, 5840       | Reclaim above 5905     |

## Mindset and Regime Notes

- Do not predict intraday direction
- Focus only on setups that match edge
- Treat 5925 as the battle line between bulls and bears
- Kira: Market is shrugging off bearish news; bull regime still intact
- Mancini: Today is not the day to knife-catch unless failed breakdown presents at key support
