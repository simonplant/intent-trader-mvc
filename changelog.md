**Date:** 2025-05-13

### Added
- Core schemas: metadata, blueprint, status, cognitive-load
- Registry-ready prompt frontmatter throughout system
- Blueprint framework (structure, generation, adaptation, mapping)
- Intraday and cognitive prompts with full test vectors
- Status lifecycle system: transitions, updates, visualization, cycles
- Cognitive tracking system: scoring, reset protocol, adaptation matrix
- Technical pattern system with Mancini integration and level taxonomy

### Validated
