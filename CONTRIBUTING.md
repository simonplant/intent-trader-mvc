# Contributing to Intent Trader

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Intent Trader project. This system is structured for modular improvement and self-discipline in execution.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Follow YAML front matter conventions in every prompt
- No emojis, no decoration, no styling beyond plaintext
- File names should match route names, lowercase, dash-separated
- Prefer JSON format for logs over markdown
- All new prompts must be added to `registry.yaml` and `main-controller.md`
- Test your changes using `/tests/` or add new tests as needed

## Collaboration Notes

This system is personal-use only, but may be adapted to small teams in the future. Design with extensibility in mind.
