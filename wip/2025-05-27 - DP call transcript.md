# Cleaned Morning Call Transcript

Now yes, loud and clear David. Sorry about that guys, little tech problems.

So our president has done an about-face. Futures are flying this morning after he pauses tariffs to July - will not be taxing the EU 50%. And in fact, there will be a pause till July after a very positive phone call with the head of the EU. 

So here we have the Dow futures up 500, NASDAQ futures up over 300. Bitcoin did rally over the weekend as high as $110,000 - we're $109 and change right now. Gold, which has been defensive, is off of it as people go offensive this fine Tuesday.

Bitcoin is the topic of the week along with NVIDIA. Bitcoin conference in Las Vegas starts today and we do have a few big earnings reports that will certainly affect the market.

## Earnings Calendar
- **Tonight**: OKTA
- **Wednesday**: DIS, Salesforce, NVIDIA, and ELF
- **Thursday**: Costco, Marvell, and Zscaler
- **Friday**: PCE report, which will be the big economic event of the week

**MARA** price target raised to $20 from $17 at Rosenblatt - they have a buy.

**Microsoft** - Cowen raises their target to $540 from $490.

## Technical Levels

Huge move today. Resistance on the QQQ: $517 to $518. That is right where the 8 and 10 day lie. Above there, we will test those recent highs, $521 to $523.

SPY first resistance right where we came into: $587 to $588. We get through there, $594.

## Portfolio Updates

This morning, I took some profits in UNH at $302. SOXL is up like 20% since we added on Friday, so that one I'm actually pretty small - sold a lot of that because it's a huge move. Didn't sell CrowdStrike yet. I have sold two-thirds of TQQQ - monster move. And CAVA, I did sell a little bit of CAVA.

It's a day to take profits. Frankly, just be thankful we're long.

## New Trade Ideas

As far as new trades go, I'm looking - there's not a ton because we have this big up open, so it's a day to be happy we're long and take some profits.

But **PDD** obviously did not have good things to say in their earnings report. Stock is down 16-17%. It'll be a focus for the day-after trade. Clearly, Temu's having some issues. That's PDD.

**CoreWeave** - between the downgrade and some weakness we saw at the end of the week, I wonder if that's not a cute short. Nothing that I'm excited about, but a cute short. Don't forget Barclays did downgrade the stock this morning.

**TEM** gets good news in their AMRI division, their genetics division, which was a big purchase they made on some of their trials. Anyhow, the stock's up a couple dollars. Don't forget resistance at $65-66. I would trim some there.

## Key Events This Week

It is a huge week, just to go over things again:

**NVIDIA Wednesday** - it'll have large ramifications. The typical fervor into the print is not there, so maybe it can work a bit. I'm not super positive or negative because it's had a huge move, but it has at least a little less of the rah-rah-rah behind it, which bodes well for it.

**PCE will be important on Friday.**

**Tesla** - Elon is out saying he's sleeping on the floor again and really focused primarily on his companies, and therefore maybe you'll get an extended bounce there. Last I saw, up 8%. So that's something to pay attention to.

**CrowdStrike** - an amazing add by Kira. I would trim and trail, and remember that OKTA this evening will affect CrowdStrike as well.

**Pony AI** had some news, but more importantly, as I remember, Pony AI has their lock-up this week starting today. I'd love to see that stock get crushed to have a position there.

So that's some of what I'll be looking at, but again, I think it's a day to take some profits first and foremost, especially on TQQQ and SOXL. I'll be on it a bit.
