# Unified Trade Plan Analysis and Specification

## 1. Structural Analysis

### Current Definition in Domain Model
In our comprehensive domain model, the Unified Trade Plan is defined under the Trade Planning sub-domain as:

**Unified Trade Plan**: Synthesized approach
- Primary market bias
- Prioritized trade ideas
- Integrated level structure
- Execution sequence
- Risk allocation by setup
- Contingency scenarios
- Level consensus strength
- Setup validation criteria

This definition provides a solid foundation but lacks the specific integration details for combining DP and Mancini methodologies into a cohesive plan.

### Purpose and Function
The Unified Trade Plan serves as the central organizing framework for the trading day, combining insights from multiple analyst sources (primarily DP and Mancini) into a single, actionable strategy document. It represents the trader's synthesized view and prioritized approach to the trading session.

## 2. Content Analysis

By analyzing the structure of both DP morning calls and Mancini newsletters, we can identify the key components that should be integrated into the Unified Trade Plan:

### DP-Derived Components
1. **Market Context Assessment**
   - Overall market sentiment and bias
   - Key futures and index status
   - Major market movers and catalysts
   - Earnings and analyst action impacts

2. **Focus Trade Ideas**
   - High-conviction trade opportunities
   - Entry parameters with conviction level
   - Character change considerations
   - Day-after-trade opportunities

3. **Technical Level Framework**
   - Key moving average relationships
   - Support/resistance zones
   - Character status of major indices
   - Price action expectations

4. **Strategic Approach**
   - Overall trading philosophy for the day
   - Risk management considerations
   - Sector focus areas
   - Market condition responses

### Mancini-Derived Components
1. **Precise Level Structure**
   - Hierarchical support/resistance with major/minor designation
   - Exact numerical levels for indices
   - Level-to-level framework
   - Historical context for levels

2. **Mode Classification**
   - Mode 1 (trend) vs. Mode 2 (range/trap) assessment
   - Mode-specific strategy recommendations
   - Expected market behavior based on mode
   - Transition indicators to watch

3. **Failed Breakdown Opportunities**
   - Specific FB setup locations
   - Entry criteria and confirmation signs
   - Stop placement guidelines
   - Systematic management protocol (75/15/10 rule)

4. **Conditional Scenarios**
   - Bull case with triggers and targets
   - Bear case with triggers and targets
   - Level-based decision framework
   - If/then response structure

## 3. Integration Requirements

To effectively combine these components into a unified plan, the following integration approaches are required:

### Level Integration
1. **Consensus Framework Creation**
   - Identify overlapping levels from both sources
   - Calculate consensus strength for each level
   - Create hierarchical organization with significance
   - Prioritize levels based on multiple confirmations

2. **Level Context Enrichment**
   - Combine precise numerical values (Mancini) with character context (DP)
   - Integrate moving average relationships with static levels
   - Merge historical significance with current relevance
   - Create multi-timeframe level structure

### Setup Integration
1. **Setup Prioritization System**
   - Combine conviction assessment from DP with setup quality from Mancini
   - Weight setups by analyst historical accuracy
   - Rank opportunities by risk/reward potential
   - Create tiered opportunity structure (primary, secondary, watch)

2. **Execution Framework Development**
   - Integrate specific entry criteria from both sources
   - Combine DP's character assessment with Mancini's acceptance criteria
   - Develop unified stop placement guidelines
   - Create consistent position management approach

### Strategic Integration
1. **Market Condition Framework**
   - Combine DP's market sentiment with Mancini's mode classification
   - Create unified market behavior expectations
   - Develop condition-specific strategy adaptations
   - Establish primary and alternative scenarios

2. **Risk Allocation System**
   - Develop unified risk budgeting framework
   - Align position sizing with setup conviction
   - Create scaled risk approach based on setup type
   - Implement mode-based risk adjustments
