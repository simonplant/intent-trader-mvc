  - Addition of chart-analysis.md
  - Schema compliance of all major prompt objects
  - README regeneration to schema-aware structure
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Status**: Pending

### 5. üìÅ Add Prompt Index Manifest
- **Action**: Create prompts/index.md that:
  - Lists all current prompts
  - Maps them to their input/output object types
  - Makes the system browsable
- **Priority**: High (Quick Win)
- **Status**: Pending

### 6. üí° Optional Prep for Tomorrow
- **Action**: 
  - Upload INSTALL.md for onboarding flow refactoring
  - Stage draft docs: docs/system-architecture.md and docs/schema-coverage.md
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Optional

## Next Phase: v0.5.3 Inner Circle Integration

Based on the development backlog and v0.5.3 plan, the next phase will focus on Inner Circle integration with the following key components:

### 1. Moderator Benchmark Tracker
- Compare executions against DP and other moderators
- Analyze timing differences (entry/exit delta in minutes)
- Compare directional alignment and relative sizing
- Track missed moderator trades with reason categorization
- Generate moderator synchronization score

### 2. Execution Gap Analyzer
- Compare trades to the morning plan and identify discrepancies
- Detect sizing issues and timing issues
- Analyze stop placement and management
- Evaluate target achievement and runner management
- Generate plan adherence score with improvement opportunities

### 3. Perfect Trade Simulator
- Simulate optimal execution of trading plan
- Calculate theoretical maximum profit with ideal entries and exits
- Compare actual vs. optimal P&L for each setup type
- Identify highest ROI setup types and conviction levels
- Generate optimization recommendations

### 4. Trading Behavior Analysis
- Track emotional and behavioral patterns affecting execution
- Categorize decision errors
- Identify trigger conditions that lead to execution errors
- Correlate market conditions with behavioral patterns
- Generate personalized behavioral alerts

## New Commands to Implement

1. `/compare-to-moderators [date] [moderator] [metrics]`
2. `/analyze-execution-gap [date] [setup_type] [focus]`
3. `/simulate-perfect-execution [date] [risk_level]`
4. `/analyze-trading-behavior [date] [category]`
5. Enhanced `/log-session` with benchmarking capabilities

## Success Metrics for v0.5.3

The v0.5.3 release will be considered successful when:

1. You can quantitatively measure how your executions compare to DP's
2. You can identify specific patterns in missed or poorly executed trades
3. You can calculate the theoretical maximum performance of your trading plan
4. You can recognize and address behavioral patterns affecting your performance
5. You can see measurable improvement in your Inner Circle synchronization score

## Priority

Critical ‚Äî understanding the execution gap between your trades and Inner Circle moderators is essential for maximizing returns as an IC member.

This system will provide immediate, actionable insights into how you can better align with DP's trading while maintaining your individual risk parameters and profit targets.
