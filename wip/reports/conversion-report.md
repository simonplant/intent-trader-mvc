# Intent Trader Schema Migration Conversion Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents the migration of Intent Trader state files to the new canonical schema v0.5.2. The migration process successfully converted all state files while preserving all existing data. The new schema provides improved structure, consistency, and semantic clarity, enabling enhanced validation and natural language processing capabilities.

**Migration Scope:**
- ✅ `trade-plan-state.json` → Canonical `tradePlan` schema
- ✅ `my-positions.json` → Canonical `tradePosition` schema
- ✅ `transaction-log.json` → New canonical `tradeLog` schema
- ✅ `conversation-context.json` → New file with `conversationContext` schema

**Key Achievements:**
- All files now validate against the canonical schema
- Data integrity preserved through comprehensive field mapping
- Text-based classifications converted to unambiguous boolean flags
- Maximum 3-level nesting depth maintained for Claude compatibility
- Required base fields (schemaVersion, id, source, timestamp) added consistently

## Conversion Process

### Migration Approach

The migration process followed a four-step approach for each state file:

1. **Analysis**: Mapped legacy fields to canonical schema
2. **Transformation**: Converted data to new structure while preserving values
3. **Validation**: Verified schema compliance and data integrity
4. **Documentation**: Recorded all transformations and changes

The process maintained backward compatibility by preserving all existing data while bringing the structure into compliance with the canonical schema.

### Migration Utilities

A set of JavaScript utilities was created to handle the migration:

- `migrateTradePlan`: Converts trade-plan-state.json to canonical format
- `migratePositions`: Converts my-positions.json to canonical format
- `createTransactionLog`: Creates transaction-log.json based on position history
- `createConversationContext`: Initializes conversation-context.json with defaults

All utilities include validation, logging, and rollback capabilities to ensure data integrity.

## Detailed Conversion Results

### 1. Trade Plan Migration

#### Structure Changes:
- Removed outer `tradePlan` wrapper object
- Added required base fields (schemaVersion, id, source, timestamp)
- Converted nested `tradeIdeas` object with arrays to a single array
- Transformed `scenarioPlanning` object to array format
- Applied proper object hierarchy with clear boundaries

#### Field Transformations:
- Renamed `ticker` → `symbol` for consistency
- Converted text-based `conviction` to object with `level` and `phrases`
- Transformed classification texts to boolean flags
- Standardized price level formats
- Added proper metadata with lineage information

#### Data Preservation:
- All trade ideas preserved (primary, secondary, watchlist)
- All market framework data maintained
- All level framework information retained
- Risk and scenario data fully preserved

### 2. Positions Migration

#### Structure Changes:
- Converted from array in `positions` property to top-level array
- Added required base fields to each position
- Transformed entry details to canonical format
- Created proper profit object structure
- Added required classification flags

#### Field Transformations:
- Extracted base symbols from complex option symbols (e.g., "SPX 22-May-25 5870P" → "SPX")
- Preserved option details in notes field
- Converted status values ("active" → "open")
- Extracted entry date from timestamp
- Split size into shares/contracts fields

#### Special Handling:
- Complex option symbols processed to extract base symbol
- Option contract details preserved in notes field
- Trade history information preserved for audit tracking

### 3. Transaction Log Creation

A new transaction log file was created based on position history:

- Created entry transactions from position history
- Established proper schema structure
- Added timestamps and relevant position references
- Included detail text for each transaction

This log enables improved transaction history tracking and auditing.

### 4. Conversation Context Creation

A new conversation context file was created to support natural language interactions:

- Initialized with active plan and session references
- Populated focus symbols from session manifest
- Set up empty arrays for command and intent history
- Established proper system state based on session phase

This context provides the foundation for natural language command processing.

## Classification Transformation

One of the most significant improvements is the conversion of subjective text classifications to unambiguous boolean flags:

| Legacy Classification | Canonical Boolean Flags |
|----------------------|-------------------------|
| "day-after-trade" | `isDayAfterTrade: true` |
| "swing" | `isTrendFollow: true` |
| "day" | `isRangePlay: true` |
| "bull flag pattern" | `isFlagPattern: true` |
| "breakout trade" | `isBreakout: true` |
| "earnings play" | `isEarningsPlay: true` |

This transformation enables more precise categorization and filtering of trades and positions.

## Schema Validation Results

All migrated files successfully validate against the canonical schema:

- ✓ `trade-plan-state.canonical.json` - Passes all validation rules
- ✓ `my-positions.canonical.json` - All positions validate
- ✓ `transaction-log.canonical.json` - Properly structured
- ✓ `conversation-context.json` - Valid initial state

## Migration Statistics

| File | Objects Transformed | Fields Mapped | Classifications Extracted |
|------|---------------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| trade-plan-state.json | 1 plan, 3 frameworks, ~10 ideas | ~50 fields | ~15 classifications |
| my-positions.json | 3 positions | ~25 fields per position | ~5 classifications per position |
| transaction-log.json | 3 transactions | ~5 fields per transaction | N/A |
| conversation-context.json | 1 context | ~10 fields | N/A |

## Implementation Notes

### Complex Symbol Handling

Special handling was implemented for complex option symbols:

```javascript
// Input: "SPX 22-May-25 5870P"
// Output: Base symbol "SPX" with details preserved in notes
```

### Classification Extraction

Enhanced pattern matching for classification extraction:

- Expanded regex patterns to catch more classification indicators
- Applied multiple extraction methods (trade type, notes, description)
- Default values provided for missing classifications

### Nested Object Creation

Consistent approach for nested object creation:

- All objects receive base fields (schemaVersion, id, source, timestamp)
- Proper ID generation with meaningful prefixes
- Consistent origin tracking for lineage

## Recommendations

Based on the migration process and results, we recommend:

1. **Update Documentation**: Update all documentation to reference the new schema
2. **Refactor Prompts**: Modify all prompts to use the canonical schema
3. **Enhance Validation**: Implement runtime validation for all state modifications
4. **Add Schema Version Checking**: Add version checks to prevent schema mismatch

## Conclusion

The migration to the canonical schema v0.5.2 has been successfully completed, with all state files now conforming to the new structure. The improved schema provides greater consistency, semantic clarity, and validation capabilities, which will enhance the system's ability to process natural language commands and perform accurate trade classifications.

This foundation establishes a solid base for the Intent Trader v0.5.2 release, enabling further development of the natural language interface and other planned enhancements.
