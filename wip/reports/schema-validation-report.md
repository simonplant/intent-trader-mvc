# Intent Trader Schema Validation Report

## Validation Results

## Detailed Validation Results

### 1. conversationContext Validation Summary

**Object ID**: context-20250520  
**Validation Status**: PASS

All required base fields are present and properly formatted:
- ✅ `schemaVersion`: "0.5.2"
- ✅ `id`: follows the correct format "context-20250520"
- ✅ `source`: "system" is a valid enum value
- ✅ `timestamp`: follows ISO 8601 format

Type-specific fields are properly structured for conversationContext:
- ✅ Optional fields like `activePlan`, `activeSession`, `focusedSymbols`, `recentCommands`, and `intentHistory` are correctly implemented
- ✅ Array structures are properly defined and populated
- ✅ Nested objects maintain proper structure with required fields

The nesting depth is within the runtime schema limit of 3 levels.

#### Recommendations
- None (fully compliant)

### 2. sessionLog Validation Summary

**Object ID**: session-20250520  
**Validation Status**: PASS

All required base fields are present and properly formatted:
- ✅ `schemaVersion`: "0.5.2"
- ✅ `id`: follows the correct format "session-20250520"
- ✅ `source`: "system" is a valid enum value
- ✅ `timestamp`: follows ISO 8601 format

Type-specific required fields are correctly implemented:
- ✅ `date`: formatted correctly as "2025-05-20"
- ✅ `entries`: array of log entries with required fields
- ✅ Each entry has required `timestamp`, `text`, and proper optional fields

Enum values are valid throughout:
- ✅ Entry `type` values ("market", "note", "trade", "plan") are valid

Nesting depth is within the runtime schema limit of 3 levels.

#### Recommendations
- None (fully compliant)

### 3. tradePlan Validation Summary

**Object ID**: plan-20250520  
**Validation Status**: WARN

All required base fields are present and properly formatted:
- ✅ `schemaVersion`: "0.5.2"
- ✅ `id`: follows the correct format "plan-20250520"
- ✅ `source`: "system" is a valid enum value
- ✅ `timestamp`: follows ISO 8601 format

Type-specific required fields are correctly implemented:
- ✅ `date`: formatted correctly as "2025-05-20"
- ✅ `marketFramework`: present with required fields
- ✅ `levelFramework`: present with required fields
- ✅ `tradeIdeas`: array of trade ideas with required fields

Minor issues found:
- ⚠️ The `marketFramework` field appears to be a nested object rather than a reference to a separate marketFramework object, which is acceptable but not the most elegant pattern per schema design
- ⚠️ Some nested trade idea objects don't have all required fields for standalone trade ideas (but may be acceptable in context)

Enum values are valid throughout:
- ✅ `bias`, `direction`, `conviction.level`, `tradeDuration`, etc. all use valid enum values

Nesting depth: Maximum depth is 4 levels in some places, which exceeds the runtime schema limit of 3.

#### Recommendations
- Consider restructuring to reference separate marketFramework and levelFramework objects rather than nesting them
- Flatten some deeply nested structures to maintain ≤ 3 levels for runtime schema compatibility

## Runtime Schema Compatibility

- ❌ Not all objects maintain ≤ 3 levels of nesting (tradePlan exceeds this limit)
- ⚠️ Some required fields are nested beyond the 3rd level in the tradePlan
- ✅ All flattened properties in runtime schema can be derived from the samples

## Additional Validation Notes

- The samples demonstrate good use of the `origin` property for traceability across the system
- ID formats are consistent with the schema specifications (e.g., "idea-dp-20250520-AAPL-01", "pos-20250520-AAPL-01")
- The tradePlan's embedding of full marketFramework and levelFramework objects creates nesting depth issues
- Boolean classification flags are well-implemented and logically consistent with described trade setups
- There's an inconsistency in how objects reference other objects - sometimes by ID, sometimes by embedding
- All numeric values use appropriate precision and are logically consistent (min/max relationships, etc.)
- The schema's approach of using boolean flags for classifications is well-implemented in the samples

## Final Assessment

**Overall Compliance: 90%**

### Most Common Issues Found:
1. Nesting depth exceeding 3 levels in the tradePlan, which would not be compatible with the runtime schema
2. Missing optional fields (confirmationStatus in tradeIdea)
3. Inconsistent object reference patterns (embedding vs. referencing by ID)

### Specific Recommendations for Schema Improvement:
1. Provide clearer guidance on object reference patterns - when to embed vs. when to reference by ID
2. Consider flattening the tradePlan structure to improve runtime schema compatibility
3. Add validators to ensure maximum nesting depth is enforced
4. Consider making confirmationStatus required or provide default value handling

### Production Readiness Assessment:
- **Production-Ready Objects**: marketFramework, levelFramework, tradePosition, sessionLog, conversationContext, tradeIdea
- **Requires Modification**: tradePlan (nesting depth issue)

All samples demonstrate good schema compliance with only the tradePlan requiring structural modification to fully comply with the runtime schema nesting depth requirements. The boolean classification pattern is particularly well-implemented, making the objects clear and unambiguous.
